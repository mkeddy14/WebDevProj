		<p class="PageDiscription">Marvel's Spider-Man is an action-adventure game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 4, based on the Marvel Comics superhero Spider-Man. Released worldwide on September 7, 2018, it was the first licensed game developed by Insomniac.Spider-Man is an action-adventure game set in an open world modern-day New York City and played from a third-person perspective. It features combat systems such as aerial combat, Spider Sense reflexes, web-shooting, and finishing moves. The game tells an original story about Spider-Man that is not tied to any other existing piece of media, and covers both the Peter Parker and Spider-Man aspects of the character. Critics called it one of the best superhero games ever made, praising its gameplay, particularly the combat and web-swinging mechanics, graphics, narrative, characterization, and design of New York City, though felt it lacked innovation in its open world design. The game became a commercial success, selling 3.3 million copies in its first three days of release, breaking several sales records.</p>
