		<p class="PageDiscription">Fallout 76 is an online action role-playing game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks, part of the Fallout series. Released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on November 14, 2018, it is a prequel to previous series games. Fallout 76 is Bethesda Game Studios's first multiplayer game; players explore the open world, which has been torn apart by nuclear war, with others. Bethesda developed the game using a modified version of its Creation Engine, which allowed the accommodation of multiplayer gameplay and a more detailed game world. Fallout 76 was released to generally mixed reviews, with many criticizing the game's numerous technical issues, overall design, lack of gameplay purpose, and absence of human non-playable characters.</p>
