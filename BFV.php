		<p class="PageDiscription">Battlefield V is a first-person shooter video game developed by EA DICE and published by Electronic Arts. Battlefield V is the sixteenth installment in the Battlefield series. It was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on November 20, 2018. Those who pre-ordered the Deluxe Edition of the game were granted early access to the game on November 15, 2018, and Origin Access Premium subscribers on PC received access to the game on 9 November 2018. The game is based on World War II and is a thematic continuation of its World War I based precursor Battlefield 1. Pre-release reception of the game was mixed, with the announcement trailer causing backlash from fans of the series for a perceived lack of historical accuracy and the inclusion of female soldiers. Upon release, Battlefield V received generally favorable reviews. Battlefield V will focus extensively on party-based features and mechanics, scarcity of resources, and removing "abstractions" from game mechanics to increase realism. There will be an expanded focus on player customization through the new Company system, where players will be able to create multiple characters with various cosmetic and weapon options. Cosmetic items, and currency used to purchase others, will be earned by completing in-game objectives.</p>
